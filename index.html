            <h1>
                Welcome to Ms. Clark's 3rd Grade Magnet Class!
            </h1>
        
            <p>
            
            I am delighted to have you and your child join my class this year. 
            You're thinking: "Wait, did she say I just joinedher class?" Why yes, yes I did. We are all in this 
            together! Since your child is a Magnet Technology student, by default you are as well. There is a bit of
            a learning curve and it takes a little adjustment to get used to the way my class is set up. However, you'll like
            that you can see what your child is working on daily (unless it's a paper and pencil assignment). The majority
            of classwork will be completed in an online environment. You will be provided with the username and password for 
            each site your child will use throughout the course of the class.Feeling nervous? It's okay! I'm here to help. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Students will be required to work both independently and in groups. Students are expected to complete the 
            work in the time that is allotted. All actvities, unless otherwise specified, are meant to be completed in 
            the time that is given. Some students may need work in this area- and that's okay! I just need you to be
            supportive in my efforts to get your child working efficiently.
            <br>
            <br>
            Speaking of efficiency.....what does that look like? 

            <ul>
                <li>Having all supplies each day</li>
                <li>Beginning the assignment when instructed to do so</li>
                <li>In a group setting, only engaging in conversation and behavior that is related to the work</li>
                <li>Actively attempting to solve problems BEFORE asking for help</li>
            </ul>


            <p>I know it sounds like a lot, but don't worry- you and your baby can handle it!</p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    There are quite a few websites that we will use in class to complete both classwork
                    and homework. Usually on sites where students submit work, grades for the individual 
                    assignments can also be found directly on the site. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to the sites for work,
                    please make sure that you are signed up to use Infinite Campus so that you can see your
                    child's overall average in each subject. Please note the link to Microsoft Office Online
                    has the Class Notebook, Word, PowerPoint, and other applications.

            <div id="rules">
                
                <h2>
                    A Few Rules...
                </h2>

                <br>

                <p>
                    So, there are a few rules to keep in mind for both parents and students. While the basics
                    are laid out in the Student Handbook, there are some that aren't listed.

                    <br>

                    In our class, we will have rules that not only comply with school rules, but are specific to
                    our class. Please ask your children to respect and follow the rules of the class and the school.
                    It will help make our learning environment a better place for all. I know many people follow the mantra
                    that "respect is not given- it is earned", but I would like for us to travel in the opposite direction.
                    I want students to respect each other and all adults unless an issue truly causes a reason for disrepect.
                    This will help our students judge situations better and generally will have students be a little more 
                    patient and understanding of each other's opinions.

                    <br> 

                    There will be many discussions and situations where students will be forced to listen to someone else's 
                    beliefs or opinions and having a mindset of respect will help students through the process of listening
                    responding appropriately.

                    <br>

                    Now, back to the rules......... 
                    I will generally either contact you via Class Dojo and/or send home a paper that needs to be signed and returned.
                    Please return anything that requires a signature the next day. 

                    <br>

                    <h3>
                        Rules (in no particular order)
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li a href="linktodekalbcountyhandbook">DeKalb County Student Handbook</a></li>
                        <li>Follow the Rules of All Adults in the Building</li>
                        <li>Respect Your Teacher (no talking back, walking out, refusal to follow instructions)</li>
                        <li>Be Nice to Your Classmates</li>
                        <li> Keep Hands, Feet, and All Objects to Yourself</li>
                        <li> Silence in the Halls</li>
                        <li> Use Your Walking Feet While in the Building</li>
                        <li>Bring All Supplies to School Each Day</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        That's it for the rules! I do suggest that you thoroughly read the rules in the Student
                        Handbook because there are very detailed rules about other behaviors that all students
                        must follow.

                        <br>

                        What about consequences? There aren't very many things that I can do. In the classroom my 
                        consequences are as follows: Loss of Class Dojo Points, Seat Moved, Special Privelege Revoked, Call/Note 
                        Home, Time Out, and No Recess. School consquences can be more severe: In School Suspension, Out of School Suspension,
                        and Expulsion (most severe). 

                        <br>

                        <p>
                        If you have any questions involving a situation with your child, please contact me via Class Dojo- this will give you
                        the most rapid response. 
                        </p>

                    </p>
            
                </p>

            </div>

            <div id="supplies">

                <h2>
                    Supplies
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Last, but not least- actually other than behavior this is the biggest thing: SUPPLIES.
                    Please ensure that your child has all school supplies each day. One of the things that delays
                    our day the most, is students not having the things they need to complete tasks. I even suggest
                    sending more than your child needs so that I have a cache of their individual supplies, should they
                    forget something or run out.

                    <br>

                    While the supplies you purchase are for you child alone, I accept school supply donations. Please
                    stick to the things on this list- and please do not send things that haven't been asked for- students
                    usually get distracted and there are reasons I have not asked for certain supplies. 
                    Please also keep extra supplies at home for students to complete homework. Why? When students start 
                    bringing their school supplies home they get lost, broken, or they just forget to bring them back.
                    Please do not expect your child to bring school supplies home during the week.

                    <br>

                    </ol>

                    I also try to let students have a mid-morning snack each day. It's not always possible, but we usually
                    have snack 3 out of the 5 day week. Please send a healthy morning snack. I will not provide snacks for
                    the class.
